What is Ada & SPARK
===================

Meet the Ada programming language!
----------------------------------

Ada is a general purpose, modern programming language like Java, C, or C++.

* Ada was created in the 1980s for the USA’s Department of Defense (DoD).
* Ada makes code safer and more maintainable by using the compiler to find errors early.

Ada vs. C, C++, & Java
----------------------

In high reliability software, you are usually choosing between C, C++, Java, and Ada. So, why Ada?

**What is Ada good at?**
Ada is a mature language that enables you to write efficient code on a variety of platforms.  It’s known for:
* Reliability
* Maintainability
* Testability
* Formal Proofs (Bug-Free!)
